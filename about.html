            <p>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed
                from the ovary after flowering.</p>
            <div id="about-2"></div>
            <p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have
                propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed
                dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of
                food.[1] Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and
                some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.</p>
            <div id="about-3"></div>
            <p>In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that
                are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and
                strawberries. On the other hand, in botanical usage, "fruit" includes many structures that are not
                commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.[2][3] The section
                of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body.</p>
